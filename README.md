# YouTube-clone

## Introduction
### YouTube-clone as it sounds like is a clone of youtube.com. It is not interactive as I built this to practice css 

### 1. Grid
### 2. Flexbox 
### 3. Positions (Absolute, Relative and Fixed)
### 4. Navbar / Sidebar
### 5. Various image properties
### 6. How various elements are nested

## Css files

### header.css
Contains css stylling for the header or the Navbar.
It is sub-divided into right/lrft and middle sections and is a flexbox.

### videos.css
Contains css stylling for video-previews/ channel details and profile photo. 
It uses css grid that makes it responsive according to the screen size. 

### style.css
Contains styles for the sidebar.

### I have also used @media-query to make the website responsive according to the screen size.
